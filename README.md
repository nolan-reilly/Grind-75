# Grind-75

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) coding challenge, created by Yangshun Tay. It's an updated version of the Blind 75 list, aimed at helping with technical interview prep.

## Purpose

- Track my progress solving each problem.
- Share my thought process and insights.
- Practice in multiple programming languages (Python, C++, etc.).

## Structure

Each problem includes:
- 📝 A brief explanation or notes
- 💻 One or more solutions in different languages
- ⏱️ Time and space complexity (when relevant)
